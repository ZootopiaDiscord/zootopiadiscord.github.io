>Be respectful to everyone in the community
No racism, sexism, homophobic, transphobic or xenophobic remarks, joking or not.
If you have an opinion, say it respectfully and back it up with reason. Refrain from insults and trash talking.

>Keep chat clean and civil
No unrelated and/or out-of-context memes. If it does not contribute to the current conversation in a channel, do not post it.
No spamming of meaningless text, emojis or images. Three or more messages/images is considered spam.

>Keep images and discussion in their respective categories and channels
Limit excessive roleplay in public channels. Story-driven roleplay can be organised in a specific roleplaying channel category.
No pornographic or suggestive material or discussion outside of the NSFW channels. If you have to ask yourself, if what you want to post is NSFW, the answer is yes.

>Be mindful of a few taboos
Politics are strictly banned. Political discussions never end well and no one leaves happy.
Do not spoil any kind of media, no matter its age. Simply use spoiler tags. <command>||spoiler here||</>
Do <u>not</u> ping the Zootopian Police role except for emergencies such as a raid or troll. You may always ping or DM individual ZPD members when needed.

>Keep account usernames and avatars clean
No (overtly) offensive and/or NSFW avatars. Cropped NSFW images are fine as long as the avatar itself is SFW.
Keep illegible and/or obsctucting characters in usernames and chat messages to an absolute minimum. Either your username or nickname must consist entirely of the modern Latin Alphabet.
