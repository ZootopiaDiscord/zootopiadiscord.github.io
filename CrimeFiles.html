      <h1>Zootopia Crime Files Offline</h1>
		  <main>As of December 18th 2017, Disney has removed Zootopia Crime Files from various app stores. The developer behind the game, Hibernum, filed for bankruptcy and have shut down, so they can no longer support the game. We have archived the Android version of the Crime Files game so people can play the game after the content servers for the game go offline. This version can be played on almost any Android device, and Android emulators like BlueStacks to play on a PC. </main>
