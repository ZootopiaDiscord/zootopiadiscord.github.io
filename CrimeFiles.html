      <h1>Zootopia Crime Files Offline</h1>
		  <main>As of December 18th 2017, Disney has removed Zootopia Crime Files from various app stores. The developer behind the game, Hibernum, filed for bankruptcy and have shut down, so they can no longer support the game. We have archived the Android version of the Crime Files game so people can play the game after the content servers for the game go offline. This version can be played on almost any Android device, and Android emulators like BlueStacks to play on a PC. </main>

	  <h2>Installation</h2>
 <ul>
        <li>Download the both files in the folder using the link above.
          <ol>
            <li>If it's not enabled, <a href="https://android.gadgethacks.com/how-to/android-basics-enable-unknown-sources-sideload-apps-0161947/">enable</a> installation from unknown sources/sideloading on your Android device.</ol>
			<li>Install the APK.
	 <li>Copy the "Android" folder to the root of the device's storage. NOTE: Android 11 and higher will prevent you from properly adding the files from your phone, for security reasons. You will need a PC to copy the files over USB.&nbsp;(<a href="CFDataInstallPC.mp4">Video</a>)
		 <li>Start the game and enjoy!

	  <h2>Save Game</h2>
<main>As of January 15 2018, the in app purchases for the game no longer function, as Hibernum has officially been shut down. To make this game more enjoyable and lessen the grind, we have released a save file that is right after the tutorial case with what should be more than enough currency to progress through the game with boosts.</main>

<section class="rules"><h2>Save Game Installation</h2>
<ul>
        <li>Download the save <a href="https://mega.nz/#F!VkgzHACI!8-1BVOf6U4u3UGCUDwjF6g">here</a>.
			<li>Start the game once.</li>
			<li>Close the game/force stop it.</li>
			<li>Extract Save.zip to the root of your device/emulator.</li>
			<li>Navigate to Android/data/com.disney.zootopiacasefiles_goo/files/Save on your Android device/emulator.
	 <li>You should see four files. Two PlayerInventory files, and two PlayerProfile files.
	 <li>Copy the seemingly random sting of numbers and letters after "_" from one of the files.</li>
	 <li>Delete the Player files with those seemingly random strings.</li>
	 <li>Replace "YOURUUID" with the stuff you copied from your original save filename.
		 <li>Start the game, and you should have a save with premium currency that is on the 2nd case, just outside of the tutorial.
